 
There are multiple ways for a website to determine a user's location. The most consistently-accurate method is the W3C Geolocation API (you may also see this API referred to as the "HTML5 Geolocation API".
For this assignment, you are to use MDN as a resource to learn everything you can about this useful API. Start here:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API
To try out the API yourself, scroll down on that page to the "Geolocation Live Example" and look for the "Live Result" at the end.
Once you've familiarized yourself with the API, build a standalone webpage that shows a map of the user's current location. The webpage should:

1. Prompt the user to allow the use of Geolocation API
2. If the user allows the API, use the Google maps API to display a large map of their current area, with a pin on their exact location. Here's a hint on how to do that.
3. If the user doesn't allow the API, display an error message on the page instead.

Note: the "maps" in this assignment have nothing to do with the "maps" you learned about in the "maps and sets" lecture before this. It's just a coincidence.

Extra Credit:

Instead of showing a pin of their current location, show the user driving directions from their current location to the nearest library.
