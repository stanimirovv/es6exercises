The power and appeal of javascript comes largely from it's ecosystem. That is: the libraries, frameworks, and tools that have been built in Javascript (or built to make Javascript coding easier). For this project, you are going to do a "deep dive" on one of the popular Javascript libraries, and create a presentation on it to share with your classmates.

Step 1: Choose a Library

Choose a popular Javascript library to use and get familiar with. Pick one of items below, or choose your own. If you choose your own: the project must have at least 1,000 Github stars, and must be written in (or written primarily for) Javascript.

Angular (https://angular.io/)
React (https://reactjs.org/)
Vue.js (https://vuejs.org/)
jQuery (https://jquery.com/)
Lodash (https://lodash.com/)
Backbone (http://backbonejs.org/)
Underscore (https://underscorejs.org/)
D3 (https://d3js.org/)
MathJs (http://mathjs.org/)
Mocha (https://mochajs.org/)
Jest (https://jestjs.io/)

Step 2: Get familiar with it

The library you chose most-likely contains documentation or a getting-started guide. Start there, follow the examples they give you. Go through the guide until you feel somewhat comfortable with the library. Try out a few small sample projects, and play around with it for at least one day before continuing to step 3.


Step 3: Create a presentation 

Using your favorite slide-deck creator (Powerpoint, Google Slides, Apple Keynote, etc), create a presentation that explains what the library is, how it works, and why someone would want to use it. Your presentation should:

1. Be least 10 slides long
2. Include at least 3 real code examples (pasted into the slides or screenshots)
3. Be intended for an audience of other JS students (you can assume the reader knows JS, but not the library in question)
 

Extra Credit:

Rather than using a slide-deck creator, make your presentation as an interactive website instead. The website should operate just like a slide deck (users should be able to use the back and forward-arrows or the spacebar to navigate slides).  If you go this route, one these libraries might make your life easier for this part:

ImpressJs (https://impress.js.org)
RevealJs (https://revealjs.com)
RemarkJs (https://remarkjs.com)
