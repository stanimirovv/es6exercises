# SOLUTION

# PROBLEM
1. Pick which service you'd like to work with. Both Lambda and GCF have a free tier, so both should be free for you to use initially (as long as you don't exceed the free tier). Read the information on these sites to get a better idea of how the services work, and what they do:

    AWS Lambda: https://aws.amazon.com/lambda
    Google Cloud Functions: https://cloud.google.com/functions

2. After you've chosen a service, read the getting-started guides thoroughly to acquaint yourself with them. If there are multiple options for the guides, choose the "Javascript" or "Node.js" option.
3. Build a simple function that accepts one number, and returns (or calls back) the square of that number. Make sure your function is set up according to the standards for the service you chose.
4. Deploy your Lambda/GFC function live
5. Download the command-line toolkit for the service you chose so that you can interact with your cloud function.
   AWS: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-tools.html
   GCF: https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/quickstart

6. Invoke the cloud function 5 times (with different numbers) to ensure it's working properly. Then take a screenshot of your terminal. When you turn in the code for this assignment, turn in the screenshot as well.
7. Save the code you wrote for your function to either a Gist or a Github repo, and turn that in.
