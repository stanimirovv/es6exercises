 
 What is the differences between destructuring an object and destructuring an array? When would each be appropriate too use? In your own words, write 1 - 2 paragraphs explaining the different use-cases for each. If English is not your native language, feel free to write in whatever language you prefer. Just please note which language it is at the top of the assignment, so we know how to translate it.

Create a file called destructuring.js and add your explanation as comments at the top of the page.

Then, within the document write 2 code examples (1 for objects, 1 for arrays) showcasing the use-cases you explained above.


Extra Credit:

To earn extra credit, add explanations and examples for destructuring nested objects (objects within objects), and nested arrays (arrays within arrays).
